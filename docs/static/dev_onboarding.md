# The Onboarding Process

When you begin working with Big Fish Games, you will be paired with a producer who will walk you through our onboarding process. There are two onboarding components:

- Onboarding your people - i.e. developers, producers, etc
- Onboarding your game code and artifacts into our systems

## Developer Onboarding 

Each developer in the partner studios will be assigned a Big Fish user account, which will be used to access all of Big Fish systems. Once your account is set up, you can access all developer applications through our [Okta interface](https://aristocrat.okta.com).

## Game Onboarding 

Once a contract is signed, we will begin the game onboarding process. During this time, your game will be:

- Assigned a “code name” and bundle ID
- Added to our Jenkins build pipeline
- Uploaded to Nexus
- Added to the Google Play, Apple App, Facebook and/or Amazon stores
- Configured in our Rave authentication system

This will complete the initial setup and configuration for your game.
